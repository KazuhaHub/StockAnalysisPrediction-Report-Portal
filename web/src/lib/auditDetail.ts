// Turning an audit row's detail into something somebody can read.
//
// The stored detail is JSON and stays JSON: it is what the filter and any later export work
// against, and a log that recorded prose could not be queried. But the console was printing it
// verbatim, so the answer to "who read what" arrived as
// {"date":"2026-08-10","symbol":"000909","title":"000909 重组舆情分析"} — every field the writer
// happened to store, in the order a serialiser chose, punctuation and all.
//
// It was then rendered as ONE string of `label=value` joined by "·", which forced every field
// through a translation table (audit.f.*) that had to grow with the server's detail schema. That is
// an OPEN set, and the table had already fallen behind: ~90 keys written, 16 translated, the rest
// showing English field names beside Chinese ones. Adding a language multiplied the treadmill by
// three, and nothing could ever enforce it.
//
// So a detail is rendered as PARTS, and a part is one of four things — which is the distinction a
// flat string cannot make:
//
//   - lead:   the sentence's subject: what was read, run or changed. Hand-written per action, and
//             bounded, so it is worth translating.
//   - phrase: a value from a CLOSED vocabulary the server defines in Go — a refusal reason, an
//             operation, where a run came from. A reader needs the refusal in their own language,
//             not "bad_password" — and the set is small and stable, which is what makes it worth
//             translating at all.
//   - change: a PAIR of fields that are one change, not two facts (before/after, from/to). Read
//             apart they have to be diffed by eye, and the server stores them in a map — so their
//             order is alphabetical and "after" comes first.
//   - field:  everything else. The field name is an IDENTIFIER, not prose. It is shown as-is and
//             visually separated from its value, so it needs no translation at all — a field the
//             server adds tomorrow is readable the day it ships, in every language.
//
// Nothing is ever dropped for being unrecognised. A phrase falls back to its identifier, a pair
// falls back to its two sides, and a value that cannot be summarised is shown as stored — so
// seeing "reason=quantum_break" is how somebody finds out the server's vocabulary grew.
//
// The LIST shows a headline of these parts and the full record shows all of them; headline() draws
// that line and says why.
