// Two inheritance models coexist here and they are not the same, which is most of why this screen
// was hard to read:
//
//   - run governance (urgent policy, ticket weight, max queued, run window, priority) is null =
//     inherit the DEFAULT group — group model B, a flat fallback, nothing to do with the OU tree;
//   - tenancy (restricted, daily quota) inherits down the OU TREE from the parent (ADR 0022), and
//     the server already resolves `restricted_effective` for us.
//
// Every caller used to re-derive these inline, which is how the urgent tags came to contradict each
// other: a ticket count and "unlimited" were rendered by two independent conditions, so an OU
// inheriting weight 2 from Default while setting unlimited itself displayed both. The urgent policy
// is a THREE-way choice, so it has to be resolved to one answer before anything renders it.
