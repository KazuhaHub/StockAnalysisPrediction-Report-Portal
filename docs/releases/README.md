# Release notes

The annotated tag carries the release note that seeds the GitHub Release. This lets a maintainer tag
the already-green merge commit without adding a release-only commit to protected `main`. After
publication, the GitHub Release body is the live source for both the portal and operators.

Files under this directory are the archive for releases that committed their notes before this flow
was introduced. They remain readable and can still be used by the tag helper, but a new release does
not need to add one.

## Layout

Notes are filed by the tag's own year — `docs/releases/<YYYY>/<tag>.md`, where `YYYY` is the year
component the tag already carries. A year directory holds a handful of files and grows by one per
release, so the top of `docs/releases/` stays this runbook and two directories.

The retired v0.x line is the exception: it is not CalVer, and its notes were materialised from their
tags after the fact, so they sit together under `docs/releases/0.x/`.

The path is resolved by `note_path` in `scripts/lib/release.sh`. It remains the default input when
`scripts/tag-release.sh` is called without `--notes-file`, preserving the archived workflow.

Filing the notes into those directories moved them, and the relative links inside the moved ones were
rebased to the new depth. An archived file is therefore no longer byte-identical to its tag
annotation: the annotation is immutable and stays the record, the prose is unchanged, and the link is
what had to move. Nothing cut from here on moves again, so the equality below holds for every new tag.

That equality is enforced by `scripts/tag_release_test.sh` because it used to be false: `git tag -a
-F` strips every line beginning with `#` unless told not to, so every annotation cut before this
helper passed `--cleanup=verbatim` lost its Markdown headings — and any shell comment inside a
command example — while the file kept them. Tags already cut are left as they are; the next one
onward says what its file says.

The normal release path is entirely in GitHub: open **Actions → Release → Run workflow**, select
`main`, leave Version blank to derive the next CalVer number (or enter one explicitly), paste the
reader-facing Markdown notes, and choose `beta`, `stable`, or `draft`. The workflow verifies the
exact `main` commit's full CI before it creates the annotated tag. It then builds the six archives and
fixed container image, publishes the Release at the selected maturity, and lets Release channels
reconcile `:beta` and `:latest`.

The command-line equivalent remains available for recovery and automation:

```sh
scripts/tag-release.sh --next
scripts/tag-release.sh --notes-file /tmp/release.md
git push origin v2026.38
```

Without a version, the script derives one: **the week comes from the clock** (the current UTC ISO
week) and **the revision from what this checkout has** — it cuts the highest release note written for
this week that has no tag on it yet, so the note you just wrote is the release you get. With every
note for the week already tagged, the week is continuing rather than starting and it takes the next
revision. It reads local tags and the working tree only, so a clone that has not fetched cannot see a
tag cut elsewhere; naming the version explicitly is the escape hatch, and it is validated the same
way.

`--notes-file` deliberately stores the supplied text on the annotated tag without requiring the file
in the tagged commit. Without that option, the helper retains the archival behavior: it reads
`docs/releases/<YYYY>/<tag>.md` from the tagged commit and refuses an absent or uncommitted note.

The annotated note seeds a reader-note section inside the GitHub Release body, delimited by the
invisible `<!-- portal-notes:start -->` and `<!-- portal-notes:end -->` comments. Container pull and
verification instructions plus GitHub's generated pull-request list remain outside that section,
so they stay on the GitHub page without appearing in the portal's reader dialog. Releases published
before the delimiters were introduced are trimmed at those known operational headings.

**GitHub Release is the only source of truth after publication.** The portal reads the published
releases through GitHub's API and derives both the displayed reader-note section and `Stable` /
`Beta` status from the current `body` and `prerelease` fields. Editing the text between the comments
therefore changes what the portal shows. It uses conditional requests and a one-minute process
cache; when GitHub is temporarily unavailable it may serve only the last successful GitHub
response, never a compiled or locally inferred fallback.

This makes maturity genuinely mutable. Promoting one release from pre-release to full release keeps
the same tag, archives and fixed image digest. The portal reflects the new status after its cache
refresh, and the Release channels workflow reacts to GitHub's `release edited` event to reconcile
`:latest` and `:beta` against the same metadata. A full-release view shows full-release milestones;
a Beta view also includes Beta releases after the latest full-release milestone. The displayed list
is capped at 10 entries after that live filtering.

**The tag must go on a commit that has a fully green `test` run of its own** — the release workflow
refuses to publish otherwise: it looks for a completed run against that exact commit, accepting one
from a push to `main` or from a manual dispatch, and requires the whole suite, race lane included;
the race lane does not run on a pull request. The normal target is therefore the squash merge commit
from the feature PR after its main-branch run finishes. The note changes the tag object, not that
commit, so publishing needs no second PR and does not invalidate the completed CI result.

The push is a separate, deliberate command because it is the irreversible step; the script never
pushes. It refuses an empty note, a tag that already exists, and a tag that is not CalVer. With the
archival-file flow it also refuses a commit that does not contain its note; with `--notes-file`, the
specified file is copied verbatim into the annotation.

No trailing `#` comments in that block, on purpose. zsh does not treat `#` as a comment in an
interactive shell unless `INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS` is set, so a copied line with an explanation after it
passes the `#` as the commit argument and the script dies on `fatal: Needed a single revision`.

Releases are CalVer: `vYYYY.W[.R]`, where `YYYY` is the ISO week-numbering year, `W` the UTC ISO week
the series starts in, and `R` an optional revision that starts at 1 and rises for every changed set of
artifacts. Leave the revision off for the first release of a week — `v2026.38` — and add one when a
second artifact set lands in the same week. They are different numbers, so ordering never ties. There
is no `-beta`: whether a release is a pre-release or a full release is GitHub Release metadata, never
the tag, and it is what moves the rolling channels. See
[ADR 0034](../adr/0034-calver-baseline-and-database-compatibility-reset.md).

**A manually pushed tag publishes a Beta.** The GitHub Actions form can publish the tag it creates as
Beta, Stable, or leave it as a draft. In every case the pipeline builds and records the fixed image
before making the Release public. Publishing fires the `release` event, and the reconciliation
workflow then updates the rolling image channels, promoting the bytes that were already published by
digest rather than rebuilding them. To re-run that after a missed event, dispatch the **Release
channels** workflow (with `dry_run` to see the decision first).

Promote an already-published Beta without rebuilding it:

```sh
gh release edit v2026.38.10 --prerelease=false --latest
```

Demoting the same Release is also a metadata edit (`--prerelease`); channel reconciliation follows
GitHub's resulting release state. No tag, archive or fixed image is replaced in either direction.

A `release` event runs the workflow **from the tagged commit**, not from the default branch, so a fix
to `release-channels.yml` takes effect for releases tagged after the fix and reconciliation for an
already-cut tag keeps running the copy that tag carries. Dispatch that workflow when an existing
release needs the newer logic. If it moves a channel, `CHANNEL_LATEST_TAG` / `CHANNEL_BETA_TAG` in the
repository variables record where the channel was last put; an operator override lives in
`CHANNEL_LATEST_OVERRIDE` / `CHANNEL_BETA_OVERRIDE` beside them, and reconciliation never clears it.

## The v2026.38 database boundary

The first CalVer release reads exactly one database shape — the **v0.4.72** schema — and converts
nothing. It is not a compatible numbering cutover:

- **A database at the v0.4.72 shape starts as it always did**, with no migration and no writes.
- **Anything older is refused before any statement runs.** It must be started once by the v0.4.72
  binary first, which carries every migration the earlier lines accumulated.
- Existing release-note files are never back-filled. `v0.4.72` has no note file because the note
  convention post-dates some of the tags it was cut under; the bridge requirement for it lives here
  instead.

### Transition runbook

Rehearsed stop-writers → backup → bridge → verify → switch → rollback. `v0.4.72`'s binary and its
`ghcr.io` image tag are the bridge and must stay retrievable for as long as a rollback must be
possible.

```sh
# 1. Stop the portal so nothing is writing, and keep the old config.yaml and secret_key.
docker compose stop report-portal

# 2. Take a consistent backup with the product's own tool. A raw copy of a live SQLite file is NOT
#    adequate — it can miss the write-ahead log — and `backup` opens the database through the driver,
#    so it does not.
report-portal backup /backup/pre-cutover.jsonl        # 0600; carries password hashes

# 3. Bridge: start the database ONCE with v0.4.72. That release runs the accumulated migrations and
#    leaves the database at the shape the new one accepts.
docker run --rm -v /path/to/config:/app/config ghcr.io/kazuhahub/stockanalysisprediction-report-portal:v0.4.72
#    It is a normal start — let it come up, confirm the portal serves, then stop it.

# 4. Verify before switching: report count and a report reads back; an account signs in; an SSO
#    connection still decrypts (it needs the same secret_key); the fallback group exists.
report-portal backup /backup/post-bridge.jsonl

# 5. Switch to the new release. It verifies the shape and writes nothing.
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

**Rollback** is the old binary plus the retained pre-cutover database and configuration:

```sh
docker compose stop report-portal
cp /backup/pre-cutover.jsonl /backup/rollback.jsonl
report-portal restore --force /backup/rollback.jsonl     # the v0.4.72 binary, not the new one
# start the v0.4.72 image again against that database
```

Do **not** open the post-bridge database with an older binary, and do not restore a dump taken by an
older release into the new one — restore refuses it, because the dump's columns do not cover the
current schema. The release that wrote a dump is the release that has to load it.

For a Postgres deployment, `pg_dump -Fc` and `pg_restore` are the equivalents of steps 2 and 5, and
the same ordering applies: dump before the bridge, restore before reverting the image.

## Upgrade paths that are NOT supported

- **Any database older than v0.4.72, opened directly by a CalVer release.** The first CalVer release
  reads only the v0.4.72 shape, so the database has to be started once by v0.4.72 first — there is no
  direct route from v0.3.x or from an earlier v0.4.x to a CalVer release.
- **v0.4.1 → anything later.** Its adoption steps were removed in v0.4.3, so the portal refuses to
  start rather than mint a second data key and silently lose every sealed secret. Recreate the
  database, or run v0.4.2 once to migrate it first, then continue up the line to v0.4.72.
- **Restoring a dump taken by a release older than the running one.** The fix is the same: take the
  database up through the release line, then back it up again.
- **Opening a post-bridge database with an old binary**, or the reverse. Each side reads one shape;
  the rollback route is the old binary with its retained pre-cutover database.

## Recovering an interrupted image publication

Release preparation requires successful full CI for the exact commit. If no push run exists
(for example on a maintenance branch), dispatch `test.yml` on that branch and wait for it.
Different release tags may build concurrently; attempts for the same tag are serialized.

Once the fixed image exists, rebuilding or replacing the archives is refused. Once the release has been
published the whole preparation step is refused — published bytes are never replaced, so a mistake
after publication means a new number, not a re-run.
If the image push succeeded but uploading `release-metadata.json` failed, recover only that file:

```sh
python3 scripts/recover-release-metadata.py OWNER/REPO vYYYY.W.R
```

The recovery tool requires authenticated `gh` and Docker access. It verifies archive checksums,
compares both Linux binaries byte for byte with their image counterparts, and checks the image
revision against the annotated tag before uploading metadata. It never rebuilds or replaces an
archive or image. A mismatch requires a new version. Channel promotion requires all six named
archives, checksums, and matching metadata, and promotes the recorded immutable digest.

The Debian image index is pinned in `Dockerfile.release`; weekly Docker dependency updates keep
it moving through review. PR image builds read the main cache but do not export their own cache.
Only main pushes refresh the shared Actions image cache; release builds use the registry cache.
