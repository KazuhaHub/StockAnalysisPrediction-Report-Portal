# Forecast verification v2 — implementation log

Decisions taken while implementing v2 that the documents did not settle, plus the small doc/code
reconciliations made in the same PR that touched them. Newest last. Each entry: date, the question,
what I chose, why, and how to back out.

This file is not a decision record the owner must ratify; it is the running record the owner reads at
each milestone. Anything that changes product behaviour, security, schema (beyond the agreed DDL) or a
release deadline is NOT logged here — it is raised with the owner and, once answered, appears in the
decisions page.

## 2026-10-19 — R1a-β1 start

### Merge order for the owner-verified PRs
#113 (docs) and #112 (the float-architecture fix) were merged first, as instructed, so P12 (#110) and
P3 (#114) could be rebased onto `main` with single-purpose diffs. #111, #110, #114 then squash-merged.

### P5: `populationBound` holidays
The build document defines `populationBound` as "the first 15:00 Asia/Shanghai on a weekday strictly
after the earliest `made_at`", deliberately holiday-agnostic (a holiday only moves the true first S0
close later, so the bound stays conservative). I implemented it exactly so — no exchange calendar — and
added a `BI` test for the production shape (Sunday 2026-10-18 evening CST → `2026-10-19T07:00:00Z`) and
the Friday-shape case. Back out: none needed; it is the documented rule.

### P5 review follow-ups (adversarial review, 2026-10-19)
- **Write-once under a race.** The pool read is a fast path only; the authoritative gate is the
  conflict-safe write (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + `RowsAffected == 0`). This also stops a
  damaged stored value from being overwritten. Chosen over a schema constraint because `meta` is the
  frozen baseline. Back out: none — it is strictly safer.
- **A refused population write inside a multi-field POST.** The handler now parses/validates every
  field first and applies the ledger start before the benchmark, so a refusal leaves the benchmark
  unchanged. The alternative (rejecting mixed requests) would have changed the endpoint's contract.
- **Malformed input vs write-once ordering.** §4.4 lists "malformed" last, but the handler must parse
  the instant before a store call can see it, so a malformed value on an already-set ledger answers
  400 `invalid_param`, not 409 `forecast_population_set`. Both are refusals and write nothing; the
  ordering is unobservable in any other respect. Kept as-is; corrected in the §4.4 note if the owner
  wants the strict order.
- **`madeAtBefore` direction for an unparseable `made_at`.** Treated as NOT pre-live (fail-open to
  showing data). `made_at` is always server-written RFC3339, so this is unreachable; the alternate
  direction would silently hide a live set from the record, which is the worse failure. Kept, and
  documented in the function comment.
- **`forecast.population.not_counted_pre_live`** is reserved for the reading page (P10/P16); it is in
  the three locale files now so the parity test holds and P10 has the exact key to use.
- **An empty or NULL stored value.** Presence is now a row count, not a value read, so a present-but-
  empty key is still `set` (the UI does not offer a form whose save would always be refused) and the
  GET reports it `damaged` rather than as an untrusted instant. The restore prior's "unset" check is
  unchanged for an empty value (it carries from live); that direction is safe either way.

### P2 review follow-ups (2026-10-19)
- **The floor is captured once, not re-derived per read.** An earlier version re-derived it when the
  keys were absent; after audit retention that would read `MAX(reports.id)` at request time and
  perpetually count 0. Now it is stored at save time, re-derived once by `finishRestore` on the tx, and
  ensured once at boot for a boundary that predates P2; the read path only reads the stored key and
  shows nothing (`ok=false`) if it is absent.
- **`store_failed_30d` is computed once per GET**, not per covered rtype (it is ledger-wide).
- **The admin page's "since" date is rendered in Asia/Shanghai** (the boundary is a Shanghai instant),
  not by truncating the UTC string.
- **The audit deep link now actually filters:** `AuditPage` seeds its action filter from `?action=`.
  This also fixes the pre-existing `predictions.reject` and `forecast.population` links.
- **The store-failure line is per rtype and names it** (the rtype prefix), so a second covered type
  would not produce ambiguous duplicate lines.
- **Read-path/copy note (no permission change):** the old groups-page "N reports have no prediction
  row" warning is removed and the CSV's `# unrecorded=` value now means "since the ledger start"
  instead of "all history". This is the §4.5 copy change, not a scope change.
- **Legacy audit timestamps.** The floor query compares `audit_log.at >= from` lexically. Pre-v0.4.15
  audit rows use a different local format and sort earlier, which is harmless for a recent boundary
  and only latent if a boundary were ever set before that release. Noted, not changed.

### P36 decisions (2026-10-19)
- **Golden snapshot delta.** §4.6's test list said "golden snapshots unchanged", but §4.6 also adds
  `forecastCoverage.Test`; `golden_cells.json` serialises the whole struct, so every coverage block
  gains a `test` line. Regenerated in P36's own commit; values are otherwise byte-identical and
  `golden_members.json` / `golden_fixture.json` are unchanged. The doc line was corrected.
- **The test label lives in the existing panel.** A test set now renders the panel (it previously
  returned null when the only set was not accepted) with `forecast.panel.test_run` and without the
  checkpoint table. `counted_set_id` still skips test sets, so it never marks one as counted.
- **Adversarial review follow-ups (P36).** Fixed before merge: `forecast.state.test` added to all three
  locales (the other-sets list renders `forecast.state.*`); the panel prefers an accepted set over a
  newer test set and never shows the counted badge for a test; the test seed pins `made_at`/`made_on`
  (the ingest path uses the real clock); the "no state UPDATE" guard now scans every non-test `.go`
  file with a whitespace/case-insensitive regex, not just `forecast_*.go`; a backtest + `run_mode=test`
  case is pinned; `forecastCoverage.pre_live`/`test` added to the web type and the matrix bar/legend.

### P4 decisions (2026-10-19)
- **Golden delta.** §4.7 said "golden snapshots unchanged", but the same section adds
  `forecastCoverage.OffBenchmark`, which `golden_cells.json` serialises. Every coverage block gains
  `off_benchmark: 0`; all values are otherwise byte-identical. Regenerated in P4's own commit and the
  doc line corrected.
- **`mode` is 0/1 only in P4.** `enabled` is the alias; `mode:"dry"` is refused rather than stored,
  because dry-run readiness is P9's. The evaluator's existing `!= "1"` test keeps any future value off.
- **Reconciliation is boot-only for now.** P9's housekeeping will call `promoteForecastBench` daily;
  until then the effective-dated reader (`ForecastBenchFor`) already returns the right code for the new
  cohort, so the active meta value merely lags by a boot.
- **Off-benchmark is per set, not per symbol, except for the earliest.** Every accepted set whose
  frozen code differs from its cohort's benchmark is counted and excluded; if the symbol's earliest
  accepted set is off-benchmark the whole symbol is out (later sets are counted off-benchmark too), as
  §4.7 requires. In the default population the earliest set defines the benchmark, so that branch is
  defensive.
- **`counted_set_id` respects off-benchmark.** The report page's pointer now skips a set whose
  `bench_code` differs from its cohort's benchmark, so it cannot show a green "counted" badge on a set
  the statistics exclude. The cohort benchmark is the ledger-wide query, not the loaded slice.
- **A legacy `bench` plus `bench_cancel` is refused** as ambiguous, the same as `bench_schedule` plus
  `bench_cancel`; the cancel intent alone still works.
- **Adversarial review follow-ups (P4).** Fixed before merge: a save promotes a due-but-unpromoted
  schedule first, so cancelling/rescheduling cannot revert the current cohort mid-month; the pending
  pair is read in one statement and a malformed cohort is ignored; `counted_set_id` judges each
  candidate against its own cohort; the member drawer derives the benchmark with the ledger-wide query
  (and `populationFrom`), matching the matrix; the coverage bar accounts for `off_benchmark`.
- **Accepted, not a bug:** posting the *active* code as `bench_schedule` while a different change is
  pending replaces it (§4.7's table: a no-op only when nothing is scheduled). The modal posts only
  changed fields, and the legacy `bench` spelling is retired in P29.

### P1 decisions (2026-10-19)
- **Wake-only scheduling.** Before fetching a calendar, every non-terminal mark whose earliest
  possible due (a weekday projection, so a lower bound) is still in the future is rescheduled from
  the projection alone. A Friday batch therefore costs no vendor call until Monday's close, and the
  batch limit is spent on work, not on marks that cannot be due.
- **Today's arithmetic is preserved, including the extra session.** `predScheduleFor` keeps the
  present `len > n` rule and `sessions[n-1]` record; P6 changes the definition inside it. The
  characterization test pins the `len == n` / `len == n+1` boundary.
- **The heal signature drops the plan's "not due" clause**, as §5.1 says: by the β2 deploy four d5
  marks are due and the check would leave them with a phantom attempt. Returning them to pending only
  causes a fresh, recorded attempt.
- **Finality needs both halves.** A mark-specific failure becomes final only after 4 recorded
  attempts and 10 completed sessions past its due session; a source failure never increments attempts
  and never finalises. An unknown refusal code is treated as a source fault (retry forever is
  recoverable; finalising on an unclassified fault is not).
- **`predNotYetShown` during the session.** +10 minutes until 18:00, except a wake in the 09:00 hour
  moves to 15:30 the same day (rather than re-waking every ten minutes through the session); after
  18:00 it is 09:00 on the next weekday.
- **The P9 readiness gate is not built here.** This PR makes item 1 of §1.4 true (the binary contains
  P1); P9 adds the `forecast_not_ready` refusal and the per-item GET. The evaluator remains off.
- **Adversarial review follow-ups (P1).** Fixed before merge: a calendar with no session after the
  receipt reschedules instead of refusing (the baseline `no_bar` is reserved for "the start session
  exists but the stock has no bar"); `Due` is now the session after which the mark may settle, so
  `sessionsPastDue` starts at 0 and the 10-session conjunct is real (`predWakeAt` wakes on the same
  session); a source fault only refuses marks that could be due, leaving far-off checkpoints on their
  wake; a baseline deferral records S0 as its session, so the heal cannot mistake it for the pre-P1
  signature; a finalised mark records the failed attempt that finalised it; an unschedulable checkpoint
  terminalises with `no_schedule` instead of spinning; `baseline_check=refused_final` is rendered; the
  EXPLAIN tests now use the production selection text (and PG's `SET LOCAL` on the same connection).

### P6 decisions (2026-10-19)
- **S0 follows the 15:00 rule.** A receipt before 15:00 on a session starts that session; at or after
  15:00, or on a non-session, starts the next. A date is known not to be a session only once a later
  session is on the calendar, so a bar that has not arrived yet is never read as a holiday.
- **dN is the Nth session after S0**, and `Record` and `Due` are the same session: the mark may settle
  as soon as that session has completed. P1's extra-session rule and its `len > n` pin are replaced.
- **A terminal baseline is used as stored.** A later pass never recomputes S0/base/price from a revised
  vendor body.
- **The plan's transaction already writes the baseline first** (P1); P6 adds a failure seam to
  `ApplyForecastPlan` and pins that a failure on the second mark rolls the baseline and the first mark
  back.
- **Adversarial review follow-ups (P6).** Fixed before merge: a stored S0 missing from the calendar
  falls back to the receipt-based session for scheduling only (never an endless wake); a terminal
  baseline with a NULL `s0_fen` omits the return instead of recomputing the price from a revised body;
  a guarded baseline write that affects 0 rows aborts the plan (`errForecastBaselineRaced`) so a racing
  pass cannot settle on its own values; the unknown-today test now calls the evaluator path rather
  than being short-circuited by the wake-only pre-pass; a known h12 and a future bar are pinned.
- **P7 decisions.**
  - The V20 probe fixtures (a live suspended stock, a delisted one, limit days on 301/689/bj, a
    sub-¥2 stock) were not captured: they are read-only vendor probes and a synthetic bar can pin
    every rule they were meant to cover. The tests use synthetic series and the existing benchmark
    fixtures; this is the one deviation from §5.3's file list.
  - The stale valve is computed once per benchmark group from every stock body in that pass (more
    than 20% ending before the calendar's newest completed session). A fetch error is not a stale
    body, so a partial outage cannot trip it.
  - The bounded look-back (400 days) reuses the body it fetched for the marks too; otherwise the
    narrow window would refuse the very halt it just resolved.
  - The listing exemption for the daily-limit backstop is "the series' first five bars when the
    series begins at or after the window's base date".
  - A receipt after the close on a date the calendar does not show yet waits rather than comparing
    with a previous close: it may be a session whose bar has not completed, or a holiday.
  - The golden snapshots are unchanged: the fixture writes the baseline and marks directly, so P7's
    evaluator rules are not on that path. The comment in forecast_golden_test.go records this.
  - Halt evidence is stricter than §5.3's pseudo-code: a same-day vendor stamp counts only when it
    is at or after the close. A cached 14:57 body proves the stock had not traded by 14:57, not that
    it did not trade that session; the plan's "stamp date >= S" would settle a halt on a partial body.
- **P8 decisions.**
  - The qfq fixture pairs from §5.4 were not captured; every rule is pinned with synthetic raw and
    adjusted closes, including a property test that fen rounding alone never flags. This is the
    second deviation from a P-list's fixture column, for the same reason as P7's V20 probes.
  - `adjustRatioChanged` uses the plan's exact integer comparison with the +1 fen bound. A
    degenerate (zero or negative) price never flags.
  - One qfq call per set per tick covers [base_date, latest due session], and only when at least one
    mark is actually due. A failed call defers every due mark `fetch_failed` (source class).
  - A missing adjusted close for either the base or the due date is also `fetch_failed`: the check
    is part of the answer, never skipped.
- **P8 review follow-ups.** The qfq call is made only when at least one due mark's stock leg can
  actually resolve (bar present and both index dates printed), not merely when a mark is scheduled;
  and `TestAdjustFetchOnlyForDueMarks` now asserts d5 resolves, so the adjusted map is proven used
  rather than merely fetched.
- **P16a decisions.**
  - `predHitClass` thresholds on the raw fen upside, `abs(terminal-s0)*10000 < 500*s0`, so 4.99% is
    untested and 5.00% is tested, exactly as the plan's `|d|*10000 < predHitUpsideBp*s0Fen`.
  - A zero excess is `flat` and is counted in the hit-rate denominator (agree+disagree+flat), because
    the plan defines the hit rate over the tested subset; a flat row is a tested row that did not
    agree. A member with NO benchmark excess is `untested` and is not in the denominator at all:
    there is nothing to agree or disagree with (F08).
  - `golden_members.json` is regenerated in its own commit: `agree` (bool) → `direction` (four
    states). Cell states, n, and every member's identity and outcome fields are unchanged.
  - `golden_cells.json` is regenerated in the same commit: `hit_n` falls by one in every resolved
    column because one fixture member has no benchmark excess and is now untested rather than flat.
    The hit/null/p values move with the denominator; no other metric changes.
  - The members route returns the gate's `state` and no counts: the drawer's headline already comes
    from the clicked cell, so repeating the counts was dead surface. A non-mature cell sends
    identity and status only.
- **P16a review follow-ups.** A member with no benchmark excess is `untested`, not `flat` (F08): the
  cell's hit denominator now excludes it, which is why `golden_cells.json` moved from 34 to 33 in
  every resolved column. The members route reads the official month's cached cell state so a
  backdated set cannot make the drawer disagree with the matrix, and `TestMembersRouteScoresNothing`
  clicks twice to cover the memo. The gate's response counts and the unused UI fields were dropped.
  The two snapshot files are regenerated in their own commit with the byte-level explanation above.

## Current progress (2026-10-20)

- **Merged.** R1a-β1 complete (P5 #116, P2 #117, P36 #118, P4 #119). R1a-β2 complete: P1 #120,
  P6 #121, P7 #122, P8 #123, P16a #124. R1b: P9 #127, P41 #129. `main` is at `077b7406`.
- **In flight.** No branch is open. Nothing is unmerged.
- **Next step.** P10 `fix/forecast-reading-hotfix` (§6.3, C1–C5/C7/C8): stop the reading page saying
  false things before any mark resolves.
- **Open questions.** None blocking. The only recorded deviations are the uncaptured V20 probe
  fixtures (P7) and the qfq fixture pair (P8); both are noted in this log with the reason and the
  synthetic coverage that replaces them.
- **Evaluator state.** `forecast_auto` must remain OFF until R1b ships and the readiness list is
  green.

### P9 — operating the evaluator

- **Mode.** `forecast_auto` now carries `0` / `dry` / `1`. `step` reads it first and, when it is
  off, performs exactly that one read: the off path has no heartbeat, no write and no fetch. The old
  binary reading `dry` as off is deliberate and is the rollback story.
- **Dry writes are prevented at one door.** Every ledger write in a pass goes through
  `applyPlan`; it drops the plan in dry mode, and in mode 1 drops it for a benchmark with no recorded
  hand check (`forecast_dry_gate`), recording the code in the heartbeat's `awaiting_gate`. A separate
  "what would happen" path would have drifted from the real one, which is why the same planner runs.
- **Readiness is the §1.4 list, items 1–5.** Item 6 (ledger chain) is absent until P23 and a test
  pins the count at five. Item 5 reads `forecast_alert_test_ok_at`, which P41 writes; until then
  mode 1 is reachable only by failing that item, so the evaluator stays off after this PR even if
  every other item holds. That is the release order, not an oversight.
- **The gate codes are the union of the active benchmark and every code frozen by an accepted set
  with a non-terminal mark.** Pre-live sets are included on purpose: the evaluator settles them, and
  counting only in-population sets would leave the list empty at the switch. With no accepted set at
  all the active code is listed, so the item is never vacuously true.
- **Watchdog.** Its own goroutine, its own recover, one settings read while off. `stalled` after ten
  minutes (at most hourly), `lagging` on a due mark over six hours, a tripped valve, or a benchmark
  calendar still ending before today after 18:00 CST on a weekday (at most daily). `no_source` is not
  emitted before P23, as the plan says: there is no ledger chain to check yet.
- **Restore (§3.3).** `forecast_eval_state`, `forecast_alert_state`, `forecast_dry_gate` and
  `forecast_alert_test_ok_at` are deleted on this transaction; the mode is the lower of dump and
  live (`0 < dry < 1`), audited only on a real change; and a result of `1` is capped at `dry` with
  `{reason:"restore_gates_empty"}`, because the gates were just reset and mode 1 without them would
  plan every set and write none. The audit row is written through the restore's own transaction.
- **Health route.** `GET /healthz/forecast` is public and answers exactly `{"ok":…}`, 503 when the
  mode is not off and the heartbeat is missing or older than ten minutes. A switched-off evaluator is
  200.
- **Deviations from the plan's test list.** `TestWatchdogRunsWhileCleanupIsSlow` is a timing
  assertion (the watchdog shares no lock with cleanup), and the panic tests drive `step` and the
  watchdog's safe wrapper rather than an infinite ticker. `Healed` stays 0: the repair runs at boot,
  not per pass, and nothing in P9 changes that.

### P41 — alert channels

- **Two channels beside the webhook.** `forecastAlert` sends one message to the configured recipients
  (through `sendEmail`, so a disabled or unconfigured SMTP is a recorded channel outcome, not a
  silent drop) and to the Slack webhook. The webhook event itself is still fired by the producer —
  the watchdog and the store-failure branch — so a reason produces exactly one webhook delivery and
  one delivery per channel. A failing alert never fails the operation that produced it.
- **The Slack URL is write-only and host-locked.** It is stored to be POSTed to, never returned, and
  only `https://hooks.slack.com` is accepted (a test-only loopback allowance exists for httptest). A
  transport error from `net/http` carries the URL, so the error is scrubbed before it is stored,
  logged or shown.
- **`forecast_alert_state` changed shape.** It now holds `{last: {reason: at}, channels: {email:
  {at,ok,error}, slack: …}}`. `last` is the watchdog's de-duplication; `channels` is the page's last
  delivery. An older flat map is ignored once, which re-fires each reason one time after the upgrade.
- **The test alert is the readiness item.** `POST /api/admin/forecast/alert-test` writes
  `forecast_alert_test_ok_at` only when BOTH channels succeed and answers 502 with the per-channel
  errors otherwise. A real change to either channel deletes the stamp: the previous test no longer
  proves the channel that is configured now.
- **The ingest path is asynchronous.** The `predictions.store_failed` alert runs in its own goroutine
  with its own recover, after the ledger write has returned, so the producer's response never waits
  on SMTP or Slack and the alert never runs inside a transaction.
- **Not in the e2e script.** A test alert needs a real mailbox and Slack webhook; section G's
  readiness check therefore still sees item 5 fail on the throwaway portal. The channels are pinned
  by unit tests with the mail seam and an httptest Slack stub.
- **P41 review follow-ups.** The scrub now removes every spelling of the URL (`raw`, `u.String()`,
  `u.RequestURI()`), because `url.Parse` normalises an uppercase scheme and the raw string alone
  would have missed. Redirects are refused (`CheckRedirect` → `ErrUseLastResponse`): a 302 would
  leave the host list and turn the POST into a GET whose 2xx looks like a delivery. A change to the
  SMTP configuration now clears `forecast_alert_test_ok_at` too, and a stamp in the future is not
  accepted. The card requires BOTH channels for readiness (not "any"), treats a stamp older than
  thirty days as unverified, keeps a typed webhook when the save is refused, and translates the three
  known channel errors.
