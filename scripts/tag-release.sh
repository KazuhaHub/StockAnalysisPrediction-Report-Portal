# Cut an annotated release tag from its release note.
#
# The convention this encodes (see docs/releases/README.md): a release tag is ANNOTATED and its
# message is the release note verbatim, so `git tag -n99 vYYYY.W[.R]` and the file in docs/releases/
# — filed by the tag's own year, docs/releases/<YYYY>/<tag>.md — say the same thing. Placed on the
# commit where that release's work is complete — usually the merge that brought it into main.
#
# Until now that lived in whoever cut the last one's memory, which is why v0.4.42 and v0.4.43 sat on
# main untagged.
#
#   scripts/tag-release.sh                 derives this week's number and tags HEAD
#   scripts/tag-release.sh dacc4328        the same, on that commit
#   scripts/tag-release.sh --next          prints the number it would derive, and changes nothing
#   scripts/tag-release.sh v2026.38.2      that exact number, without deriving anything
#
# The examples carry no trailing '#' comment on purpose: zsh does not enable INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS,
# so a line copied out of documentation with an explanation after it hands the '#' to this script as
# the commit argument. The guard below turns that into a sentence instead of a git error.
#
# It does not push. Pushing a tag is the one irreversible step here, so it stays a separate,
# deliberate command — which the script prints for you.
#
# Maturity is NOT decided here. The tag is only the number; whether the release is a pre-release or
# a full release is GitHub Release metadata, set at publication (docs/adr/0034).
