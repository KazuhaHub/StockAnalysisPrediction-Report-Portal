# annotation for 64 releases without anyone noticing: `git tag -a -F` defaults to `--cleanup=strip`,
# which drops any line starting with `#`. The convention is that `git tag -n99 <tag>` and the file in
# docs/releases say the same thing, and nothing was checking it.

# Everything happens in a throwaway git repository, so the real one is untouched.
