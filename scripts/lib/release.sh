# note_path ROOT VERSION — the file VERSION's release note lives in.
#
# Notes are filed by the tag's own year, docs/releases/<YYYY>/<tag>.md, so the path is a function of
# the number rather than of the clock: a note written in one year for a tag whose week belongs to the
# next still lands beside its number. A year directory holds a handful of files and grows by one per
# release, which is what keeps the top of docs/releases/ readable.
#
# VERSION is expected to be a CalVer tag, whose first component is the four-digit year; the retired
# v0.x line is not one and was filed under docs/releases/0.x/ when it was archived. Callers validate
# the tag before asking (scripts/tag-release.sh refuses a non-CalVer argument outright).

# derive_version ROOT WEEK — prints the number a maintainer would pick by hand, or fails with the
# reason on stderr.
#
# WEEK is a parameter rather than something read from the clock here, so the boundaries — week 1,
# week 9, week 53, a year rollover — are tested by naming them instead of by waiting for them.
#
# Only the week is computed; the revision comes from what this checkout already has. The rule is the
# first one a person would apply: cut the note you just wrote, meaning the highest release note for
# this week with no tag on it yet. With every note for the week already tagged, the week is
# continuing rather than starting, so it is the revision after everything this week has.
#
# It reads local tags and the working tree only. A clone that has not fetched cannot see a tag cut
# elsewhere, which is why naming the version explicitly stays the escape hatch.
