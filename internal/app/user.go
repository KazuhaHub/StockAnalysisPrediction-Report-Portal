// normalizeUsername is the canonical form of an account name: trimmed and folded to lower case.
//
// It exists because userPrincipal folds and the storage does not. A read principal has to be stable,
// so it folds; `users.username` is a plain TEXT PRIMARY KEY, which is BINARY on SQLite and
// case-sensitive on Postgres. While the two disagreed, `Alice` and `alice` were two accounts sharing
// the one principal `u:alice` — each read what the other had been granted, and deleting either wiped
// both their viewer rows.
//
// The Passwall panel never had to write this down: its `upn` UNIQUE index is MySQL under a utf8mb4
// collation, so the database refuses the case variant for it. Neither of this project's drivers does,
// so the fold happens here, at every creation path, and the guards compare through it. Folding at
// write rather than comparing case-insensitively at read keeps every lookup an exact primary-key hit.
