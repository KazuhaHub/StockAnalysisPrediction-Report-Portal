// Self-service account security (ADR 0023). The 2FA, recovery-code and passkey machinery all existed
// with no way for a user to reach it: enrolment was an admin errand and a forgotten password needed
// an emailed link even for someone already signed in. These are the two pieces that make the
// account page possible — the state it branches on, and the one credential change it did not have.

// apiChangePassword replaces the caller's own password.
//
// The current password IS the step-up here, rather than the X-Step-Up-Proof header the credential
// routes use: it is the very credential being replaced, so proving it is both necessary and
// sufficient, and it is the interaction every other product has trained users to expect. It shares
// the login throttle for the same reason step-up does — this is an online guessing oracle for the
// current password, and the login form is not allowed to be one either.
